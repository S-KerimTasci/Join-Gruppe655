                        legal bases of the
                        GDPR on which we process personal data. Please note that in addition to the provisions of the
                        GDPR, national data
                        protection regulations may apply in your or our country of residence or domicile. Furthermore,
                        if more specific
                        legal bases are relevant in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the privacy policy.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR)</strong> - The data subject has given consent to the
                            processing of
                            his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Performance of a Contract and Pre-contractual Inquiries (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR)</strong>
                            - Processing is
                            necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party or for the
                            implementation of
                            pre-contractual measures taken at the data subject's request.</li>
                        <li><strong>Legitimate Interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR)</strong> - Processing is necessary for the
                            purposes of the
                            legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such
                            interests are overridden
                            by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require
                            protection of personal

                    <p><strong>National data protection regulations in Germany:</strong> In addition to the data
                        protection regulations of
                        the GDPR, national regulations on data protection apply in Germany. This includes, in
                        particular, the Federal Data
                        Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz â€“ BDSG). The BDSG contains specific provisions, in
                        particular, on the right
                        to access, the right to erasure, the right to object, the processing of special categories of
                        personal data, the
                        processing for other purposes, and the transmission and automated individual decision-making,
                        including profiling. In
                        addition, state data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.</p>

                    <div class="subtitle" id="m27">Security Measures</div>

                    <p>We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with legal requirements,
                        taking into
                        account the state of the art, the implementation costs, and the nature, scope, circumstances,
                        and purposes of the
                        processing, as well as the varying probabilities of occurrence and the extent of the threat to
                        the rights and
                        freedoms of natural persons, to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.</p>
                    <p>These measures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability
                        of data by
                        controlling physical and electronic access to the data, as well as the related access, input,
                        disclosure,
                        availability, and separation thereof. Furthermore, we have established procedures to ensure the
                        exercise of data
                        subjects' rights, the erasure of data, and responses to data threats. We also consider data
                        protection in the
                        selection of hardware, software, and procedures, according to the principle of data protection,
                        by design and by
                        default settings.</p>
                    <p>TLS encryption (https): To protect the data transmitted via our online offering, we use TLS
                        encryption. You can
                        recognize such encrypted connections by the prefix https:// in the address bar of your browser.

                    <div class="subtitle" id="m25">Transmission of Personal Data</div>

                    <p>In the course of our processing of personal data, it may be necessary to transmit the data to
                        other entities,
                        companies, legally independent organizational units, or individuals, or to disclose or transfer
                        them to them. The
                        recipients of this data may include service providers entrusted with IT tasks or providers of
                        services and
                        content integrated into a website. In such cases, we comply with legal requirements and conclude
                        appropriate
                        contracts or agreements that serve the protection of your data with the recipients of your data.
                    </p>

                    <div class="subtitle" id="m24">International Data Transfers</div>

                    <p>Data processing in third countries: If we process data in a third country (i.e., outside the
                        European Union (EU)
                        or the European Economic Area (EEA)) or if the processing takes place in connection with the use
                        of third-party
                        services or the disclosure or transfer of data to other persons, entities, or companies, this
                        only occurs in
                        compliance with legal requirements. If the level of data protection in the third country has
                        been recognized by
                        means of an adequacy decision (Art. 45 GDPR), this serves as the basis for data transfer.
                        Otherwise, data
                        transfers only occur if the level of data protection is otherwise guaranteed, particularly
                        through standard
                        contractual clauses (Art. 46(2)(c) GDPR), explicit consent, or if transmission is necessary for
                        contractual or
                        legal reasons (Art. 49(1) GDPR). Furthermore, we will provide you with information on the bases
                        of third-country
                        transfers for the individual providers from the third country, whereby adequacy decisions take
                        precedence. Information
                        on third-country transfers and existing adequacy decisions can be found in the information
                        provided by the European

                    <p>EU-US Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework: As part of the so-called "Data Privacy Framework"
                        (DPF), the European
                        Commission has also recognized the level of data protection as safe for certain companies from
                        the USA in the context
                        of the adequacy decision of July 10, 2023. The list of certified companies and further
                        information on the DPF can be
                        found on the website of the US Department of Commerce at <a class="link"

                            target="_blank">https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/</a>. As part of the data protection
                        information, we will inform
                        you about the service providers we use who are certified under the Data Privacy Framework.</p>


                    <div class="subtitle" id="m12">Deletion of Data</div>
                    <p>The data processed by us will be deleted in accordance with legal requirements as soon as the
                        consents for processing
                        are revoked or other permissions cease to apply (e.g., when the purpose of processing this data
                        no longer applies
                        or they are not required for the purpose). If the data is not deleted because it is necessary
                        for other legitimate
                        purposes or for legal reasons, its processing will be limited to these purposes. This means that
                        the data will be
                        blocked and not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data that must be
                        retained for reasons
                        of commercial or tax law or whose storage is necessary for the assertion, exercise, or defense
                        of legal claims or
                        for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person.</p>
                    <p>Our privacy notices may also contain further information on the storage and deletion of data that
                        primarily apply
                        to the respective processing.</p>

                        as for creating analyses of visitor flows.</p>
                    <p><strong>Notes on Consent:</strong> We use cookies in accordance with legal requirements.
                        Therefore, we obtain prior

                        if the storage and
                        reading of information, including cookies, are absolutely necessary to provide users with a

                    <p><strong>Notes on Data Protection Legal Bases:</strong> The data protection legal basis on which
                        we process users'
                        personal data using cookies depends on whether we ask users for consent. If users consent, the
                        legal basis for
                        processing their data is the declared consent. Otherwise, the data processed using cookies based
                        on our legitimate
                        interests (e.g., in the operation of our online offering in a cost-effective manner and
                        improving its usability)
                        are processed, or if the use of cookies is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations when
                        using cookies is
                        necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations. The purposes for which cookies are processed
                        by us are clarified
                        in the course of this privacy policy or in the context of our consent and processing procedures.

                    <p><strong>Storage Period:</strong> With regard to the storage period, the following types of
                        cookies are distinguished:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Temporary Cookies (also: Session Cookies):</strong> Temporary cookies are deleted at
                            the latest after
                            a user has left an online offering and closed his or her terminal device (e.g., browser or
                            mobile application).</li>
                        <li><strong>Persistent Cookies:</strong> Persistent cookies are stored even after the terminal
                            device has been
                            closed. For example, login status can be stored or preferred content can be displayed
                            directly when a user
                            revisits a website. Similarly, data collected using cookies from users can be used for reach
                            measurement.
                            Unless we provide explicit information about the type and storage period of cookies (e.g.,
                            as part of obtaining
                            consent), users should assume that cookies are permanent and can have a storage period of up
                            to two years.</li>
                    </ul>

                        consent given at any
                        time and object to processing according to legal requirements. To do so, users can restrict the
                        use of cookies in
                        their browser settings (although this may also restrict the functionality of our online
                        offering). Objection to the
